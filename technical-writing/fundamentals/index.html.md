The Technical Writing Fundamentals course is available to help both GitLab and community contributors write and edit documentation for the product. This course provides direction on grammar and topic design. 

This class is **not required** to contribute to docs.gitlab.com. Everybody can contribute!

You can review the training materials on this page, or you can take [the course in GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/ECL-02528ee2-c334-4e16-abf3-e9d8b8260de4) to earn a badge.

## Technical Writing Fundamentals course

The Technical Writing Fundamentals course consists of the following sections to be completed in order. 

### Google Technical Writing One pre-class material

Complete the pre-class exercises from this excellent Google training. You can take the associated Google class if you like, but the GitLab Technical Writing Fundamentals sessions 1-4 cover the information that is relevant for GitLab.

[**Start with the pre-class work** ~12 short sessions](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one).
