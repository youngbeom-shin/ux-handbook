The term "usability" can mean a variety of things. At GitLab, we use the following definition of usability when we conduct user research and design our product:

**To be usable, an interactive system should be useful, efficient, effective, satisfying, and learnable.**

* **Usefulness** is the degree to which our product enables a user to achieve his or her goals. 

* **Efficiency** is the quickness with which the user’s goal can be accomplished accurately and completely in a period of time.

* **Effectiveness** refers to the extent to which the interactive system behaves in the way that users expect it to and the ease with which users can use it to do what they intend.

* **Learnability** is a part of effectiveness and has to do with the user’s ability to operate the interactive system to some defined level of competence after some predetermined amount and period of training (which may be no time at all). It can also refer to the ability of infrequent users to relearn the system after periods of inactivity.

* **Satisfaction** refers to the user’s perceptions, feelings, and opinions of the product. 



*Note: This definition is based on information from the [Handbook of Usability Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Usability-Testing-Conduct-Effective/dp/0470185481) and the [International Usability and UX Qualification Board curriculum](https://uxqb.org/public/documents/CPUX-F_EN_Curriculum-and-Glossary.pdf).*
