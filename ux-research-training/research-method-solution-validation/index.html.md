### Why we employ solution validation
Solution validation research critically assesses if the product/feature/design has indeed solved the problem that was initially intended to be solved. Essentially, this phase validates or negates the proposed solution(s) identified during the problem validation research.

To choose the right **solution validation** research method, you need to identify the purpose for your research. Ask yourself **_“What information do I need to learn to increase my confidence in the design?”_** Your answer will help you choose which method to use. If you are still unsure, please reach out to your UX Researcher.
