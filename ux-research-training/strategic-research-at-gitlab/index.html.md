### What is Strategic Research?

UX has shifted the way Product Management chooses to develop products and solutions. When we consider UX for product strategy, we begin to [explore other ways](http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/january-february-2017/strategic-ux) to solve customer problems, understand market pain points, and meet user expectations.

We can use Strategic Research to:

- Understand how to apply a solution across different territories or groups of people. For example, consider how a different industry, like lawyers curating legal documentation, could leverage source control management for versioning. 
- Explore additional constraints to the current problem to make it more future proof -- for example, adding the number of concurrent users to support on a feature.  
- Consider upstream and downstream experiences -- for example, enhancing the Verify experience for GitLab users by using Auto DevOps to help them get started more easily with Continuous Integration. 
- Identify emerging market trends. For example, if customers are signaling an interest in their maturity for adopting DevOps, uncover ways can GitLab coach people in their maturity using Machine Learning or AI.

### How does GitLab think about Strategic Research?

**Strategic research is research that is:**
* Conducted to directly inform the strategy of a team and/or organization
* Aimed at answering broader research questions, not specific to a single stage area or feature
* More closely tied to problem validation than solution validation
* Independent from the monthly release cycle
* Focus is 6 months to 3 years ahead

**What it is NOT:**
* [Solution validation](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/solution-validation-and-methods/)
* Specific to a single stage group (in most cases)
* Problem validation research tied to a specific issue/feature

**What does Strategic Research look like?**

* Research that informs the UX and/or product direction
* Research that spans the user journey, rather than product group 
* Research that seeks to understand and challenge current assumptions of feature functionality 
* Research that engages cross-stage or multi-stage stakeholders
* Research that defines unmet needs
* Research that results in the addition, refinement, or removal of personas

**How is Strategic Research measured?**
* Success will be measured by the impact of the research, at the project level.  As strategic research matures at GitLab, we will look for common measures of success that could be applied to all strategic research projects.

**Examples of great Strategic Research**
* Understanding stage usage trends
* Expanding understanding of our customers' motivations, goals, challenges, and needs
* Identifying our customers' biggest IT initatives/goals
* Understand how GitLab can overcome DevOps adoption pains
* Understand more about cross-stage use cases and workflows
* Identify ways Ops can drive adoption across multiple stages and stage groups

### Strategic Research Outputs

The outputs from Strategic Research can be found in Issues, changes made to documentation, and in published changes to a category direction page (which includes 1 year and 3 year visions), such as:

* [GitLab 3-year strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#3-year-strategy)
* [GitLab's Direction Personas](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#personas)
* [Dev Section 1-year Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/dev/#dev-section-fy22-themes)
* [Ops Section 1-year Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#ops-section-plan)
* [Sec Section 1-year Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security/#1-year-plan) 

### How does a Strategic Research Program operate?

**Note:** A Lead UX Researcher is the person who devises the research brief and provides an initial outline of the study's goals and hypotheses. A Lead UX Researcher can hold any level of seniority and experience, from Research Coordinator to Staff UX Researcher. The Lead UX Researcher is the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) for the research study. They should communicate that they are the DRI during stakeholder meetings and within research issues.

1. Lead UX Researcher meets with the relevant PM(s), fellow UX Researcher(s), Research Coordinator(s), and UX Research Manager to discuss the goals of the study and the hypotheses they have. The purpose of this meeting is to get buy-in from all stakeholders. If a stakeholder is unable to attend the meeting, record the session and offer the opportunity to provide feedback asynchronously.
1. Lead UX Researcher creates an issue using the [Problem Validation template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Problem_Validation.md).
1. Lead UX Researcher applies the ~"workflow::problem validation" label to the associated issue, which automatically removes the ~"workflow::validation backlog" label.
1. Lead UX Researcher completes an [opportunity canvas](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research/#opportunity-canvas) to the best of their ability. Ensure the problem and persona are well articulated and add the opportunity canvas to the issue's [Designs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html#the-design-management-page). Note that you should include content for the solution and go-to-market sections, possibly with low confidence. This section is likely to change, but thinking it through will help clarify your thoughts.
1. Lead UX Researcher opens a problem validation research issue using the available template in the UX Research project, completes it, applies the `UX Problem Validation` label, and assigns the issue to the relevant UX Researcher(s).
1. Follow the steps outlined for [user interviews](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/writing-usability-testing-script/) or surveys. However, for multi-stage-group initiatives, the Lead UX Researcher should take responsibility for all steps outlined in the user interview or survey process -- for example, writing a discussion guide. They are welcome to delegate responsibilities to other UX Researchers, if they need assistance.
1. Lead UX Researcher meets with the relevant PM(s), UX Researcher(s), and UX Research Manager to discuss findings and next steps.
The Lead UX Researcher may be required to:
    * Finalize the opportunity canvas with the synthesized feedback.
    * Present the opportunity canvas to Scott Williamson, Christie Lenneville, and the relevant Product Director(s).
