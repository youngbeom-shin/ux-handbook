### What is cross stage research?

We have learned new [namespaces](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#namespaces) adopting 3 or more stages has significantly higher free to paid conversion rate, and the more stages a customer uses, the deeper the engagement, the stickier GitLab becomes, which also makes it the harder for customers to leave. Additionally, more stage usage creates more monetization opportunities in terms of upsell as well expansion for our business. 

GitLab is invested in supporting this described adoption of the product across an organization and it is tracked as [stages per organzation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#stages-per-organization-spo) and [stages per user](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#stages-per-user-spu). In order for us to better understand how and why users are adopting more stages, we have established a Cross Stage Research Program. 

### How does the Cross Stage Research Program work?
