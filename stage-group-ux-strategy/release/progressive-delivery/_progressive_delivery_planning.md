Our planning and build process is detailed on our [planning page](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/release/progressive-delivery/planning).

### Async Release Planning

Progressive Delivery works with monthly and quarterly planning issues using the [release planning issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/progressive_delivery/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/ReleaseTemplate.md) to plan our release-level priorities over each milestone. These issues contains individual sections for deliverables, capacity, team member vacation, and more. This issue allows the entire group to view high-level planning including what we seek to accomplish in a given release. This type of issue is the central location for information gathering and planning conversations.

Planning issues are considered SSOT until they are closed as the milestone has begun. After that, the issue metadata is the leading SSOT. Additionally, Progressive Delivery honors items in the current milestone over scheduled future milestone items.

Needs weight issues are used by engineering to dedicate `workflow::planning breakdown` activities. If an issue has no weight it should preferably first pass through a needs weight issue to be assigned a weight. Afterwards it can be proposed in the planning issues. Additionally, Product Design can indicate in these issues by the use of this [issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1884154) where there is an additional need for engineering involvement to push forward issues in the `workflow::design` phase.
