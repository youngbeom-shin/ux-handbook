## Overview

Hello! We're the GitLab CI/CD UX team. We're comprised of three stage groups that support designing and building the GitLab DevOps product: [Verify](/direction/ops/#verify), [Package](/direction/ops/#package), and [Release](/direction/ops/#release).

Our design mission is to bring simple, clean ways to make GitLab the tool of choice for deploying where, when, and how users want.

We work to ensure the best user experience for our users of all knowledge levels, allowing them to successfully apply the continuous methods (Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment) to their software with no third-party application or integration needed.

## How we work

We follow the workflows outlined in the [UX section](/handbook/engineering/ux/how-we-work/) of the handbook. In addition,

* we lay down [team OKRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd-ux/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all&label_name[]=OKR) to execute our UX Department strategy.
* we use our own [UX Definition of Done (DoD)](#ux-definition-of-done-dod).
* we participate in the [monthly milestone kick off](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-department-workflow/#milestone-kickoff). Together with Product Managers, we record a video with a focus on the user experience, front-end (user interface design) and research innitiatives.
    * [View all Milestone Kickoff playlists](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/kickoff/#ops-section)
* we perform synchronous and asyncrhonous [design reviews](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-resources/#synchronous-design-reviews).
    * [Watch our syncrhonous design reviews on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYO97sRry4E&list=PL05JrBw4t0Kpnb8RDztlfpryAYip1OMwb)

### UX Definition of Done (DoD)

A Definition of Done (DoD) serves as a tool for describing and tracking the expected deliverables, objectives, and the approval process. The DoD consists of a list applied by the Product Designer and Product Manager to issues or epics, in order align and track the entry and exit criteria for design work. This list should be flexible, making this process [efficient for their ways of working](/handbook/values/#efficiency-for-the-right-group). 

Below you can find the CI/CD stage groups that are currently using a UX DoD: 

* [Release Management](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/release/release-management/)
* [Verify:Pipeline Execution](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/ci-cd/pipeline-execution/index.html#ci-ux-dod-objectives)

## Our strategy

Our strategy is all about making sure that even complex delivery flows become an effortless part of everyone's primary way of working. We work closely with Engineering, Product Management, User Research, Technical Writing, and Product Marketing to make sure we have all the support in uncovering user needs and work to solve them together. Some of our strategic initiatives are:

* [Jobs to be Done framework](/handbook/engineering/ux/jobs-to-be-done/)
* [UX Scorecards and recommendations](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-scorecards/) 
* [Opportunity canvas](/handbook/product-development-flow/#opportunity-canvas) 
* [Category Maturity Scorecards](/handbook/engineering/ux/category-maturity-scorecards/)
* Stakeholder, user, and customer interviews
* Competitive analysis

### Our strategic counterparts

We have business goals we are shooting for all the time. To understand how we can measure success in the CI/CD area, we collect insights from our strategic counterparts: [Product Marketing Managers](/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/pmmteam/), [Analyst Relations](/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/analyst-relations/), and [Customer Success](/handbook/customer-success/). 

Below you can find information about the all designated counterparts we work with:

* [Verify stage counterparts](/handbook/product/categories/#verify-stage)
* [Package stage counterparts](/handbook/product/categories/#package-stage)
* [Release stage counterparts](/handbook/product/categories/#release-stage)

## Our team meetings

### CI/CD UX Team Meeting

We meet bi-weekly as a team to discuss our work, processes, talk about User Research activities, share knowledge, and raise questions to each other. We are also using session for team retrospectives, as well as sharing useful resources around design and DevOps domains.

## Personal Growth Day (Pilot)

To ensure we continue to grow and sharpen our skills as designers, we are running a pilot where we dedicate one day per milestone to our individual growth. Our first team growth day is `2021-02-25`. See the [pilot issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd-ux/-/issues/26). 

On our dedicated personal growth day: 
* Our external syncs are cancelled or moved
* We don't work on product design work for the day
* Our team syncs are dedicated to sharing resources, providing feedback on growth plans, etc.
