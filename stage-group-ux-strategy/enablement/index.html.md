## Overview
The Product Designers for Enablement focus on Distribution, Ecosystem and Geo. While these are quite different areas with their own Jobs to Be Done, the over-arching theme is making GitLab easier to install, use, and integrate, so that people can get started fast and without friction and use GitLab where and when it works for them. GitLab believes that **everyone can contribute**, and this is central to our strategy.

## Our strategy
The Enablement UX team will work with PMs to uncover customer's core needs and workflows. Becoming strategic involves gathering research, looking for patterns, and making plans for the best path forward for our customers and users. It is also about deciding what we value most, and how to best work together to achieve our goals.
